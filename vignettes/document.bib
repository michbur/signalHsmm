For some time methods for doing this have been available in the area of protein structure prediction. We have developed a similar procedure based on pair-wise alignments for sequences with functional sites. We show how a correlation coefficient between sequence similarity and functional homology can be used to compare the efficiency of different similarity measures and choose a nonarbitrary threshold value for excluding redundant sequences. The impact of the choice of scoring matrix used in the alignments is examined. We demonstrate that the parameter determining the quality of the correlation is the relative entropy of the matrix, rather than the assumed ({PAM} or identity) substitution mode. Results are presented for the case of prediction of cleavage sites in signal peptides. By inspection of the false positives, several errors in the database were found. The procedure presented may be used as a general outline for finding a problem-specific similarity measure and threshold value for analysis of other functional amino acid or nucleotide sequence patterns.},

	abstract = {A hidden Markov model of signal peptides has been developed. It contains submodels for the N-terminal part, the hydrophobic region, and the region around the cleavage site. For known signal peptides, the model can be used to assign objective boundaries between these three regions. Applied to our data, the length distributions for the three regions are significantly different from expectations. For instance, the assigned hydrophobic region is between 8 and 12 residues long in almost all eukaryotic signal peptides. This analysis also makes obvious the difference between eukaryotes, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria. The model can be used to predict the location of the cleavage site, which it finds correctly in nearly 70\% of signal peptides in a cross-validated test–almost the same accuracy as the best previous method. One of the problems for existing prediction methods is the poor discrimination between signal peptides and uncleaved signal anchors, but this is substantially improved by the hidden Markov model when expanding it with a very simple signal anchor model.},

We show that the dataset used in these studies is linearly separable and that it is a misuse of nonlinear classifiers to apply them to this problem. The best solution on this dataset is achieved using a linear classifier like the simple perceptron or the linear support vector machine, and it is straightforward to extract rules from these linear models. We identify key residues in peptides that are efficiently cleaved by the {HIV}-1 protease and list the most prominent rules, relating them to experimental results for the {HIV}-1 protease. {MOTIVATION}: Understanding {HIV}-1 protease specificity is important when designing {HIV} inhibitors and several different machine learning algorithms have been applied to the problem. However, little progress has been made in understanding the specificity because nonlinear and overly complex models have been used. {RESULTS}: We show that the problem is much easier than what has previously been reported and that linear classifiers like the simple perceptron or linear support vector machines are at least as good predictors as nonlinear algorithms. We also show how sets of specificity rules can be generated from the resulting linear classifiers. {AVAILABILITY}: The datasets used are available at http://www.hh.se/staff/bioinf/},

However, it is still difficult for researchers to choose the best method due to the lack of an effective comparison. For the first time we have made an extensive study on methods for feature extraction, feature transformation and multiclassifier systems ({MCS}) in the problem of {HIV}-1 protease. In this work we report an experimental comparison on several learning systems coupled with different feature representations. We confirm previous results stating that linear classifiers obtain higher performance than non-linear classifiers using orthonormal encoding, but we also show that using Karhunen-Loeve transform the performance of neural networks are comparable to one of linear support vector machines. Finally we propose a new hierarchical approach that, for the first time, combines ideas derived from the machine learning methodologies and from a knowledge base of this particular problem. This approach proves to be a successful attempt to obtain a drastically error reduction with respect to the performance of linear classifiers: the error rate decreases from 9.1\% using linear-{SVM} to 6.6\% using our new hierarchical classifier based on some pattern rules.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jmb.2004.03.016},
	abstract = {An inherent problem in transmembrane protein topology prediction and signal peptide prediction is the high similarity between the hydrophobic regions of a transmembrane helix and that of a signal peptide, leading to cross-reaction between the two types of predictions. To improve predictions further, it is therefore important to make a predictor that aims to discriminate between the two classes. In addition, topology information can be gained when successfully predicting a signal peptide leading a transmembrane protein since it dictates that the N terminus of the mature protein must be on the non-cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Here, we present Phobius, a combined transmembrane protein topology and signal peptide predictor. The predictor is based on a hidden Markov model ({HMM}) that models the different sequence regions of a signal peptide and the different regions of a transmembrane protein in a series of interconnected states. Training was done on a newly assembled and curated dataset. Compared to {TMHMM} and {SignalP}, errors coming from cross-prediction between transmembrane segments and signal peptides were reduced substantially by Phobius. False classifications of signal peptides were reduced from 26.1\% to 3.9\% and false classifications of transmembrane helices were reduced from 19.0\% to 7.7\%. Phobius was applied to the proteomes of Homo sapiens and Escherichia coli. Here we also noted a drastic reduction of false classifications compared to {TMHMM}/{SignalP}, suggesting that Phobius is well suited for whole-genome annotation of signal peptides and transmembrane regions.

As a consequence, signal sequences can have important roles in modulating protein biogenesis.

Furthermore, we detected signals corresponding to an alteration of positively and negatively charged residues at a distance of 3-4 amino acids. To look beyond the property codes gained by the methods of physical chemistry, mappings yielding a strong correlation signal are sought for using a Monte Carlo simulation. The mappings leading to strong signals are found to be related to hydrophobicity of alpha-helix propensity. A cluster analysis of the top scoring mappings leads to two novel property codes. These two property codes are gained from sequence data only. They turn out to be similar to known property codes for hydrophobicity or polarity.},

	abstract = {As a first step toward understanding the topology of the signal peptide with respect to the membrane during the protein export process, we have examined the constraints on the length of the cleavage region needed to achieve signal peptidase recognition and cleavage. Using the signal peptide of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, a series of cleavage region mutants has been constructed. Variations in length were brought about by replacing the wild type cleavage region of the signal peptide with polymers of increasingly more residues. In each case, alanine residues are used exclusively in the -1 and -3 positions to provide only one viable cleavage site. Glutamine residues are used in all other positions in order to vary the length from 3 to 13 total residues. Analysis of these mutants revealed that cleavage regions ranging from 3 to 9 residues are completely and efficiently processed. The extent of processing drops substantially thereafter, with no processing observed for signal peptides with 13-residue long cleavage regions. A second mutant with a 13-residue long cleavage region was designed and analyzed to ensure that the lack of processing reflected a cleavage problem and not a translocation defect. The results are consistent with the notion that the signal peptidase active site is in close proximity to the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane and that interaction of the cleavage region with the signal peptidase probably depends on, and is constrained by, other interactions involving the signal peptide.},

	abstract = {Functioning as an "address tag" that directs nascent proteins to their proper cellular and extracellular locations, signal peptides have become a crucial tool in finding new drugs or reprogramming cells for gene therapy. To effectively and timely use such a tool, however, the first important thing is to develop an automated method for rapidly and accurately identifying the signal peptide for a given nascent protein. With the avalanche of new protein sequences generated in the post-genomic era, the challenge has become even more urgent and critical. In this paper, we have developed a novel method for predicting signal peptide sequences and their cleavage sites in human, plant, animal, eukaryotic, Gram-positive, and Gram-negative protein sequences, respectively. The new predictor is called Signal-3L that consists of three prediction engines working, respectively, for the following three progressively deepening layers: (1) identifying a query protein as secretory or non-secretory by an ensemble classifier formed by fusing many individual {OET}-{KNN} (optimized evidence-theoretic K nearest neighbor) classifiers operated in various dimensions of {PseAA} (pseudo amino acid) composition spaces; (2) selecting a set of candidates for the possible signal peptide cleavage sites of a query secretory protein by a subsite-coupled discrimination algorithm; (3) determining the final cleavage site by fusing the global sequence alignment outcome for each of the aforementioned candidates through a voting system. Signal-3L is featured by high success prediction rates with short computational time, and hence is particularly useful for the analysis of large-scale datasets. Signal-3L is freely available as a web-server at http://chou.med.harvard.edu/bioinf/Signal-3L/ or http://202.120.37.186/bioinf/Signal-3L, where, to further support the demand of the related areas, the signal peptides identified by Signal-3L for all the protein entries in Swiss-Prot databank that do not have signal peptide annotations or are annotated with uncertain terms but are classified by Signal-3L as secretory proteins are provided in a downloadable file. The large-scale file is prepared with Microsoft Excel and named "Tab-Signal-3L.xls", and will be updated once a year to include new protein entries and reflect the continuous development of Signal-3L.},

The method employed is based on a position weight matrix approach improved by a frequency correction which takes in to consideration the amino acid bias present in proteins. The software was trained using sequences extracted from the most recent version of the {SwissProt} database. {PrediSi} is accessible via a web interface. An extra Java package was designed for the integration of {PrediSi} into other software projects. The tool is freely available on the World Wide Web at http://www.predisi.de.},

	abstract = {Spider neurotoxins are commonly used as pharmacological tools and are a popular source of novel compounds with therapeutic and agrochemical potential. Since venom peptides are inherently toxic, the host spider must employ strategies to avoid adverse effects prior to venom use. It is partly for this reason that most spider toxins encode a protective proregion that upon enzymatic cleavage is excised from the mature peptide. In order to identify the mature toxin sequence directly from toxin transcripts, without resorting to protein sequencing, the propeptide cleavage site in the toxin precursor must be predicted bioinformatically. We evaluated different machine learning strategies (support vector machines, hidden Markov model and decision tree) and developed an algorithm ({SpiderP}) for prediction of propeptide cleavage sites in spider toxins. Our strategy uses a support vector machine ({SVM}) framework that combines both local and global sequence information. Our method is superior or comparable to current tools for prediction of propeptide sequences in spider toxins. Evaluation of the {SVM} method on an independent test set of known toxin sequences yielded 96\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity. Furthermore, we sequenced five novel peptides (not used to train the final predictor) from the venom of the Australian tarantula Selenotypus plumipes to test the accuracy of the predictor and found 80\% sensitivity and 99.6\% 8-mer specificity. Finally, we used the predictor together with homology information to predict and characterize seven groups of novel toxins from the deeply sequenced venom gland transcriptome of S. plumipes, which revealed structural complexity and innovations in the evolution of the toxins. The precursor prediction tool ({SpiderP}) is freely available on {ArachnoServer} (http://www.arachnoserver.org/{spiderP}.html), a web portal to a comprehensive relational database of spider toxins. All training data, test data, and scripts used are available from the {SpiderP} website.},

Here we show the bacterial expression, purification, and reconstitution of proteolytically active signal peptide peptidase ({SPP}), a membrane-embedded enzyme in the presenilin family of aspartyl proteases. This finding formally proves that, unlike presenilin, {SPP} does not require any additional proteins for proteolysis. Surprisingly, the conserved C-terminal half of {SPP} is sufficient for proteolytic activity; purification and reconstitution of this engineered fragment of several {SPP} orthologues revealed that this region defines a functional domain for an intramembrane aspartyl protease. The discovery of minimal requirements for intramembrane proteolysis should facilitate mechanistic and structural analysis and help define general biochemical principles of hydrolysis in a hydrophobic environment.},

The crystal structure of the conserved {SRP} ribonucleoprotein core, however, raised the surprising possibility that electrostatic interactions between basic amino acids in signal peptides and the phosphate backbone of {SRP} {RNA} may also play a role in signal sequence recognition. To test this possibility we examined the degree to which basic amino acids in a signal peptide influence the targeting of two Escherichia coli proteins, maltose binding protein and {OmpA}. Whereas both proteins are normally targeted to the inner membrane by {SecB}, we found that replacement of their native signal peptides with another moderately hydrophobic but unusually basic signal peptide ({DeltaEspP}) rerouted them into the {SRP} pathway. Reduction in either the net positive charge or the hydrophobicity of the {DeltaEspP} signal peptide decreased the effectiveness of {SRP} recognition. A high degree of hydrophobicity, however, compensated for the loss of basic residues and restored {SRP} binding. Taken together, the data suggest that the formation of salt bridges between {SRP} {RNA} and basic amino acids facilitates the binding of a distinct subset of signal peptides whose hydrophobicity falls slightly below a threshold level.},

	abstract = {Fast and effective prediction of signal peptides ({SP}) and their cleavage sites is of great importance in computational biology. The approaches developed to predict signal peptide can be roughly divided into machine learning based, and sliding windows based. In order to further increase the prediction accuracy and coverage of organism for {SP} cleavage sites, we propose a novel method for predicting {SP} cleavage sites called Signal-{CTF} that utilizes machine learning and sliding windows, and is designed for N-termial secretory proteins in a large variety of organisms including human, animal, plant, virus, bacteria, fungi and archaea. Signal-{CTF} consists of three distinct elements: (1) a subsite-coupled and regularization function with a scaled window of fixed width that selects a set of candidates of possible secretion-cleavable segment for a query secretory protein; (2) a sum fusion system that integrates the outcomes from aligning the cleavage site template sequence with each of the aforementioned candidates in a scaled window of fixed width to determine the best candidate cleavage sites for the query secretory protein; (3) a voting system that identifies the ultimate signal peptide cleavage site among all possible results derived from using scaled windows of different width. When compared with Signal-3L and {SignalP} 4.0 predictors, the prediction accuracy of Signal-{CTF} is 4–12 \%, 10–25 \% higher than that of Signal-3L for human, animal and eukaryote, and {SignalP} 4.0 for eukaryota, Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. Comparing with {PRED}-{SIGNAL} and {SignalP} 4.0 predictors on the 32 archaea secretory proteins of used in Bagos’s paper, the prediction accuracy of Signal-{CTF} is 12.5 \%, 25 \% higher than that of {PRED}-{SIGNAL} and {SignalP} 4.0, respectively. The predicting results of several long signal peptides show that the Signal-{CTF} can better predict cleavage sites for long signal peptides than {SignalP}, Phobius, Philius, {SPOCTOPUS}, Signal-{CF} and Signal-3L. These results show that Signal-{CTF} is more accurate and flexible in predicting signal peptides of different characteristics for many organisms.

In this paper we expand upon this work by making use of the more powerful class of dynamic Bayesian networks ({DBNs}). Our model, Philius, is inspired by a previously published {HMM}, Phobius, and combines a signal peptide submodel with a transmembrane submodel. We introduce a two-stage {DBN} decoder that combines the power of posterior decoding with the grammar constraints of Viterbi-style decoding. Philius also provides protein type, segment, and topology confidence metrics to aid in the interpretation of the predictions. We report a relative improvement of 13\% over Phobius in full-topology prediction accuracy on transmembrane proteins, and a sensitivity and specificity of 0.96 in detecting signal peptides. We also show that our confidence metrics correlate well with the observed precision. In addition, we have made predictions on all 6.3 million proteins in the Yeast Resource Center ({YRC}) database. This large-scale study provides an overall picture of the relative numbers of proteins that include a signal-peptide and/or one or more transmembrane segments as well as a valuable resource for the scientific community.

Here, we demonstrate that the popular {BLASTP} alignment tool can be tuned for signal peptide prediction reaching the same high level of prediction success. Alignment-based techniques provide additional benefits. In spite of high success rates signal peptide predictors yield false predictions. Simple sequences like polyvaline, for example, are predicted as signal peptides. The general architecture of learning systems makes it difficult to trace the cause of such problems. This kind of false predictions can be recognized or avoided altogether by using sequence comparison techniques. Based on these results we have implemented a public web service, called Signal-{BLAST}. Predictions returned by Signal-{BLAST} are transparent and easy to analyze.

	abstract = {Protein signal peptides play a vital role in targeting and translocation of most secreted proteins and many integral membrane proteins in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Consequently, accurate prediction of signal peptides and their cleavage sites is an important task in molecular biology. In the present study, firstly, we develop a novel discriminative scoring method for classifying proteins with or without signal peptides. This method successfully captured the characteristics of signal peptides and non-signal peptides by integrating hydrophobicity alignment and positionspecific amino acid propensities based on the highest average positions. As a result, this method is capable of discriminating proteins with signal peptides at the overall accuracies of 96.3\%, 97.0\% and 97.2\% by leave-one-out jackknife tests on the constructed benchmark datasets for three different organisms, i.e. Eukaryotic, Gram-negative, and Gram-positive respectively. Secondly, we consider the prediction task of signal peptide cleavage sites as a sequence labeling problem and apply Conditional Random Fields ({CRFs}) algorithm to solve it. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed {CRFs}-based cleavage site finding approach can achieve the prediction success rates of 80.8\%, 89.4\%, and 74.0\% respectively, for the secretory proteins from three different organisms.

	abstract = {Recombinant biotherapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies are mostly produced in Chinese hamster ovary ({CHO}) cells and pharmaceutical companies are interested in an appropriate platform technology for the development of large-scale production processes. A major aim of our study was therefore to improve the secretion efficiency of a recombinant biotherapeutic antibody by optimizing signal peptides. Reporter molecules such as gaussia and vargula luciferase or secreted alkaline phosphatase are frequently used to this end. In striking contrast, we used a biotherapeutic antibody that was fused to 16 different signal peptides during our study. In this way, the secretion efficiency of the recombinant antibody has been analyzed by transient expression experiments in {CHO} cell lines. Compared to the control signal peptide, it was not possible to achieve higher efficiencies with signal peptides derived from a variety of species or even natural immunoglobulin G signal peptides. The best results were obtained with natural signal peptides derived from human albumin and human azurocidin. These results were confirmed by fed-batch experiments with stably transfected cell pools, in which cell-specific productivities up to 90 pg cell(-1) day(-1) and product concentrations up to 4 g L(-1) could be determined using the albumin signal peptide. Finally, the applicability of the identified signal peptides for both different antibodies and non-antibody products was demonstrated by transient expression experiments. In conclusion, it was found that signal peptides derived from human albumin and human azurocidin are most appropriate to generate cell lines with clearly improved production rates suitable for commercial purposes in a product-independent manner.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Computational prediction of signal peptides is of great importance in computational biology. In addition to the general secretory pathway (Sec), Bacteria, Archaea and chloroplasts possess another major pathway that utilizes the Twin-Arginine translocase (Tat), which recognizes longer and less hydrophobic signal peptides carrying a distinctive pattern of two consecutive Arginines ({RR}) in the n-region. A major functional differentiation between the Sec and Tat export pathways lies in the fact that the former translocates secreted proteins unfolded through a protein-conducting channel, whereas the latter translocates completely folded proteins using an unknown mechanism. The purpose of this work is to develop a novel method for predicting and discriminating Sec from Tat signal peptides at better accuracy.
Results: We report the development of a novel method, {PRED}-{TAT}, which is capable of discriminating Sec from Tat signal peptides and predicting their cleavage sites. The method is based on Hidden Markov Models and possesses a modular architecture suitable for both Sec and Tat signal peptides. On an independent test set of experimentally verified Tat signal peptides, {PRED}-{TAT} clearly outperforms the previously proposed methods {TatP} and {TATFIND}, whereas, when evaluated as a Sec signal peptide predictor compares favorably to top-scoring predictors such as {SignalP} and Phobius. The method is freely available for academic users at http://www.compgen.org/tools/{PRED}-{TAT}/.

	abstract = {Predictive accuracy has been used as the main and often only evaluation criterion for the predictive performance of classification learning algorithms. In recent years, the area under the {ROC} (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve, or simply {AUC}, has been proposed as an alternative single-number measure for evaluating learning algorithms. In this paper, we prove that {AUC} is a better measure than accuracy. More specifically, we present rigourous definitions on consistency and discriminancy in comparing two evaluation measures for learning algorithms. We then present empirical evaluations and a formal proof to establish that {AUC} is indeed statistically consistent and more discriminating than accuracy. Our result is quite significant since we formally prove that, for the first time, {AUC} is a better measure than accuracy in the evaluation of learning algorithms.},

	abstract = {The area under the {ROC} curve ({AUC}) is a very widely used measure of performance for classification and diagnostic rules. It has the appealing property of being objective, requiring no subjective input from the user. On the other hand, the {AUC} has disadvantages, some of which are well known. For example, the {AUC} can give potentially misleading results if {ROC} curves cross. However, the {AUC} also has a much more serious deficiency, and one which appears not to have been previously recognised. This is that it is fundamentally incoherent in terms of misclassification costs: the {AUC} uses different misclassification cost distributions for different classifiers. This means that using the {AUC} is equivalent to using different metrics to evaluate different classification rules. It is equivalent to saying that, using one classifier, misclassifying a class 1 point is p times as serious as misclassifying a class 0 point, but, using another classifier, misclassifying a class 1 point is P times as serious, where p≠P. This is nonsensical because the relative severities of different kinds of misclassifications of individual points is a property of the problem, not the classifiers which happen to have been chosen. This property is explored in detail, and a simple valid alternative to the {AUC} is proposed.},

We review and extend work showing that one of these methods is clearly inappropriate, and then conduct an empirical analysis with a large number of datasets to evaluate the real-world implications of our theoretical analysis.
